ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sonu, a Software engineer, CodePath.org fellow, Develop For Good volunteer and Northwestern college student passionate about increasing diversity and equity in technology. I was born in Birgunj, Nepal in a multicultural family and I am currently based in Iowa, United States. My journey as a first generation college student to software engineer has shaped me into the person I am today. Coming from a non-traditional background, I am committed to impacting people's lives through the medium of technology. ðŸš€
