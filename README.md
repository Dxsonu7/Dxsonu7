I'm Sonu—I've completed 4+ internships, specializing in full-stack development, Generative AI, and mobile software projects with a focus on architectural patterns. I excel in cross-cultural and cross-functional communication, collaborating with product managers, designers, and engineers to build client-centric solutions that enhance user experience. By leveraging data-driven insights, I help businesses make informed decisions and drive impact.

💻 I fell in love with computers at the age of 8 — breaking them apart, putting them back together, troubleshooting until they worked, and building computers for family and friends. The problem-solving, the satisfaction of turning parts into something functional, and the endless possibilities of the digital world — especially software and cybersecurity — kept me hooked. I’ve always been passionate about learning and consuming tech content. That same excitement reignited during my senior year of high school, leading me to earn a full scholarship to study Computer Science. Now, I'm finalizing my degree in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering and have interned at leading companies.
