ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sonu, a Software Engineer, College and CodePath.org student passionate about increasing diversity and equity in technology. I was born in Birgunj, Nepal in a multicultural family and I am currently based in Iowa, United States. My journey as a Third culture individual to Software Engineer has shaped me into the person I am today. Coming from a non-traditional background, I am committed to making technical knowledge accessible in hopes to inspire and empower others to pursue careers in technology, ultimately making a positive impact in the world. ðŸš€
