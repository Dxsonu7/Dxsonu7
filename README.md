I'm Sonu — I've completed 4+ internships, focusing on full-stack development, Gen AI, and mobile software projects with an emphasis on architectural patterns.
I excel in cross-cultural/cross-functional communication, collaborating with product managers, designers, and engineers to develop client-centric solutions that enhance user experience. By leveraging data-driven insights, I help businesses make informed decisions.

### 🚀 A little about my background

💻 I fell in love with computers at the age of 8, fixing old laptops and building computers for family and friends. The problem-solving, the satisfaction of turning parts into something functional, and the endless possibilities of the cyber world—especially cybersecurity—kept me hooked. I’ve always been passionate about learning and consuming tech content. That same excitement reignited during my senior year of high school, leading me to earn a full scholarship to study Computer Science. Now, I'm pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering and Mathematics, and I've interned at top Fortune companies.
